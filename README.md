# Kevi & Decembers Roblox game

## Claude Code plugins

`.claude/settings.json` makes Claude Code offer the game's plugins on any PC that opens this repo.

- Ponytail and claude-obsidian install automatically after you trust the folder.
- claude-skills is registered as a marketplace, but no bundles are on yet. Add the ones you want to `enabledPlugins`, for example `"product-skills@claude-code-skills": true`.

## Graphify (once per PC)

Graphify is a separate program, so each PC installs it once:

```bash
uv tool install graphifyy
graphify install --project
```

Then run `/graphify .` in Claude Code.

## Obsidian notes

Keep the claude-obsidian vault inside this repo (for example a `wiki/` folder) so your notes travel with it.
